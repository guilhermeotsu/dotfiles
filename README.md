# My person dotfiles for neovim

I'm a csharp developer and studie some javascript frameworks/libs, so this configs is for this. I like to keep my enviroment simple, so i just have LSP, some server configured, Treesiter for syntax-highlited and Fuzzy Finder, that's all i need. I like to use tmux too.

It's very simple but made of heart.
